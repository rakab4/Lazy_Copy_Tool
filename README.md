As the name of software says, it is a copy tool which copy the STRING to clipboard so user can paste it to anywhere.

As shown image above, let's say you have some strings (part numbers, or any numbers, or file names) that you have to frequently copy and paste. But to do so, you have to go to specific directory or the place, and copy the string. 

This application can help you store those strings with a few word description and an associate image to identify the string. For example, if you're a mechanical designer (like me), you might want to set string as a frequently used Part numbers (or assembly numbers) with an image and description, so you will be able to identify the Part number. 

If you're a data entry associate, you might want to add repetitive NAMES, ADDRESSES, AREAS, etc. 

Give it a try and if you have any feedback, feel free to contact me or download the code, play around. 

P.S: I am not an expert programmer, I am still learning. This application is written in non-OOP python because I am still learning OOP.
